# SAP Commerce Cloud Sample Repository

This sample repository contains the files and folders that are required to set up SAP Commerce Cloud. There are multiple branches covering different scenarios for Commerce Cloud (e.g. project Spartacus, data hub, solr customizations).  You can clone/download this repository, checkout the branch of interest and then follow the instructions in the readme to update the example files with your specific details. 
This branch covers a Commerce Cloud 2211 sample scenario that is based on the [CX recipe](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a74589c3a81a4a95bf51d87258c0ab15/latest/en-US/f09d46cf4a2546b586ed7021655e4715.html) with Spartacus 4.3. Deprecated extensions have been excluded with the exception of yacceleratorstorefront, which contains sample data required for this sample demo. It is not recommended to use the deprecated yacceleratorstorefront extension.

When your files are ready, push them to your SAP Commerce Cloud repository.  

# Requirements

- You have a public-facing code repository.
- You have an active SAP Commerce Cloud subscription.
- You have a license for a [supported SAP Commerce release](https://help.sap.com/viewer/dc198ac31ba24dce96149c8480be955f/latest/en-US/1c6c687ad0ed4964bb43d409818d23a2.html)

# Supported Versions

You can find the supported SAP Commerce versions listed in the [Compatibility help topic](https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/v1905/en-US/31ac209eb08f41bc92e9bbe5772fb949.html).

# Download and Installation
Not applicable.

# Configuration

These instructions walk you through the process of cloning the repository and then updating the sample files with your specific requirements. 

The following folders and files are included in the sample repository.

Root level
- `core-customize` folder: The folder that contains all of the folders and files that support Commerce Cloud.
- `js-storefront` folder: A project Spartacus JS Storefront configured with Server Side Rendering (SSR). For more on project Spartacus see [project Spartacus documentation](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/)

`core-customize` folder
- `manifest.json`: The Commerce Cloud manifest.json file, which defines how your code will be built and deployed in the Public Cloud environments. The manifest is set up to leverage [configuration reuse](https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/latest/en-US/2311d89eef9344fc81ef168ac9668307.html) to better allow for consistency between local and cloud builds.
- `hybris `folder: contains a sample custom folder for storing any custom extensions as well as the config folder for storing local and cloud properties, `localextensions.xml` and any local solr/tomcat configurations
- `other sample manifests`: A collection of tested and verified manifest files that you can use as starting points for your Commerce Cloud environments.

### Clone Repository

Clone the sample repository ([instructions can be found here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)). The files are copied to your local machine.

### Update the Custom Extensions

1. If you donâ€™t have custom extensions, you can delete the `kiwi` & `tiger` sample folders. If you wish to use these extensions you'll have to uncomment them in your `core-customize/hybris/config/localextensions.xml` folder
2. List any extensions you're using (custom and any from Commerce runtime) in the `core-customize/hybris/config/localextensions.xml` file
3. If you have custom extensions with dependencies, configure the dependencies in `extesioninfo.xml` accordingly. Extensions are built in the order in which they appear in your `localextension.xml` and `manifest.json` files

### Update the Commerce Cloud manifest.json

1. Open the `manifest.json` file inside the `core-customize` folder.
2. Update the `version` with the version of SAP Commerce that you plan to use. Refer to the Supported Versions section of this readme for more information.
3. Save the changes.

### Prepare to Push the Sample Repository
 
In the sample repository, verify that you have the following files in the `core-customize` folder.
 - `manifest.json`:  This is the manifest.json for Commerce Cloud.
 
### Push the Commerce Cloud Configuration to Code Repository

Push all the contents from your local machine to the root level of your Commerce Cloud repository.

### Access the Cloud Portal

Log in to the Cloud  Portal and verify that your code repository is connected.

1. From a supported browser, log in to https://portal.commerce.ondemand.com. For more information, see [Accessing the Cloud Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0c2050f6d31f49ddb6eba18509060ae5/latest/en-US/bc745004669445478d0c0505d77e096c.html).
2. Select *Repository* and verify that you are connected to the correct code repository.
3. Find the environments that were provisioned for your subscription.
3. Create a new build.
4. Deploy the build to the environment using the *Initialze Database* option.

You may also wish to see [this video](https://enable.cx.sap.com/playlist/dedicated/116161351/1_6tm85g61/1_df6ptanl) which provides a walkthrough of how to connect your repository, as well as [this video](https://enable.cx.sap.com/playlist/dedicated/116161351/1_6tm85g61/1_9ogbv7hz) which outlines how to build and deploy.

### Final Steps - Validating an example Spartacus Electronics Storefront

Use the Cloud Portal to create a build and then deploy the build to an environment.

See [Build and Deploy your First SAP Commerce Cloud Project](https://www.sap.com/cxworks/article/2589632836/build_and_deploy_your_first_sap_commerce_cloud_project) for all the steps to build and deploy.

1. After the build is deployed, you can find the 'JS Storefront' endpoint in the *Environments* page of the Cloud Portal listed under *Public Endpoints*.
2. Click on the *JS Storefront* hyperlink to access the details page for endpoint.
3. Either add an IP Filter Set for your IP address OR change the Base Rule from 'Deny All' to 'Allow All' in order to receive traffic to this example storefront.
4. Save the changes.
5. Click on the URL listed next to the *JS Storefront* public endpoint. 
7. Verify that you see a basic electronics storefront.
